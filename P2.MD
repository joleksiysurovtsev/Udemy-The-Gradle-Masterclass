build.gradle file with build script usually has one to one match with project. In other words, each project
or the gradle subproject will have its own gradle-file, and it will live in the root folder of this particular project.

Also, gradle allows to build multi-project (multi-modular) projects. In other words, the project in which there are many
subprojects. In this case, the settings.gradle or settings.gradle.kts file is used for the configuration, depending on
the language in which the script is written.

Example build.gradle script on groovy

```groovy
apply plugins: 'java'

defaultTasks 'clean', 'compileJava'

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    compile: 'junit:junit:3.8.1'
}
```

Example build.gradle.kts script on kotlin

```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("jvm") version "1.8.20"
}

dependencies {
    implementation(kotlin("stdlib-jdk8"))
}
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
kotlin {
    jvmToolchain(11)
}
```

As you noticed the code of the script is not at all similar to Maven XML but the Gradle uses the same concepts or many
of the same concepts as maven regarding dependencies and repositories.
