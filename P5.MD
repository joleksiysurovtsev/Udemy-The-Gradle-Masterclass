## Strings and their usage with groovy ##

#### Features of working with strings in groovy ####

- In groovy, no character literals like in Java.
- String can be enclosed in double or single quotes.

```groovy
def s1 = "a string"
print s1

def s2 = 'a string'
print s2

```

- Groovy has a really nice way to work with multi-line strings using three double quotes.

```groovy
def s3 = """ A
            string
            on
            multiple
            lines
"""
print s3
```

- Groovy supports string interpolation, which basically means something like if we had a variable, say variable X, and
  we assign integer four, but we want to use that integer in our string, we can do this using dollar sign '$' like.

```groovy
def s4 = 4
print "x = $s4"
```

So we have X is X, and then when we run that, you'll notice that in the line, the total number of X's has been
replaced with a variable value of four. In the Java world, this is called interpolation. You will need to combine them.
In Groovy, you're not just limited to using variables, you can interpolate code as well, and you can do
that using the dollar sign and curly braces. And inside the curly braces, you put the code you really want to run.

- In Groovy you aren't limited to using variables, you can interpolate code as well, and you can do that using the
  dollar sign and curly braces.
  And inside the curly braces, you put the code you really want to run.

```groovy
def myCourses = 'Groovy'
println "I`m traning in: ${myCourses.toUpperCase()}"
```

`⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️ String interpolation only works when double quotes are used.`

## Properties in groovy ##

getter and setter

In groovy, getters and getters do not need to be created. We just create instance variables, and they are basically
wrapped for us with getters and setters. So we don't really need to implement this code.

So this example, we've got the class person that has two instance variables of name and age.

```groovy
class Person {

    String name
    Integer age

    Person(name, age) {
        this.name = name
        this.age = age
    }
}

def p1 = new Person(Alex, 36)
println p1.age
```

```shell
36
```

```groovy
p1.age = 37
println p1.age
```

```shell
37
```

Now you notice there are any getters and setters, and that's because groovy implements those for us behind the scenes.
So it looks like we got direct access to the instance variables, but we are actually going via getters and setters.
And that's what makes these attributes on person properties rather than just instance variables.

We really start to see the power of properties and groovy when we start using collections such as hash maps.
Getting and setting on a hash map is done using the keys, which are represent properties and groovy.
So let's have a look at this example.

We create a new hash map.

And we can, as we do in Java, use the put method, so putting the key food with the value of Fred

into the Hashmap program to get the value of food we use to get maced on the Hashmap, and we pass in the Key foo.

```groovy
Map m = new HashMap()
m.put("foo", "Fred")
println m.get("foo")
```

result:

```shell
Fred
```

And if we try that by just printing it to the console, that's exactly what we get. But we're using the property syntax.
The actual key becomes a property. So we can reference that by using the adult notations, reading dot food, which is
seen as a property.

```groovy
//Setters example
m.foo = "Bill"
m.bar = "Jane"
m.baz = "Dave"
```


```groovy
//getter example as property style
println m.foo
println m.bar
println m.baz
```

result:
```shell
Bill
Jane
Dave
```
I'm assigning that the value of Bill, and we can do the same with a couple more. We can use bar and
bars and assign those keys the value of Jane and Dave and to actually get those values, we use that dot notation as
well.
