To understand how to write Gradle scripts, we need to know that it is possible to write scripts in the Groove and Kotlin
programming languages.

### [Introduction to Groovy Syntax](P1.MD) ###

According to the Convention, the project build script is in the file build.gradle.kts or if it is written on the kotlin.
build.gradle.kts

### [BuildGradle](P2.MD) ###

As mentioned earlier, under the hood, Groovy and Kotlin use JVM, so for further work, we need to install JDK. Also, for
comfortable development, we will need to install IntelliJ IDEA.

### [Installing](P3.MD) ###

### [Starting write a Gradle Build Script](P4.MD) ###
